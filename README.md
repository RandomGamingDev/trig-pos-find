# trig-pos-find
A simple python script that uses trigonometry to find a position based on 2 points and the degree of any pointer pointing to that position in both. This is especially useful for games like Minecraft, where eyes of ender point to a structure, in this case the stronghold and where structures are placed randomly about the world.
